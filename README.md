# RIFTEHR

Relationship Inference From The EHR (RIFTEHR) is an automated algorithm for identifying relatedness between patients in an institution's Electronic Health Records.

Remember to always respect patient privacy.

This is a pure python 3.x implemntiaton of https://github.com/tatonetti-lab/riftehr orgianlly developed by http://riftehr.tatonettilab.org  Original implemention can also be found in this repo under the `modules` directory along with a README for how to run them.

Three input files are required.  A tab seperated paitent file(`pt_file.tsv`), a tab seperated emergency contact file (`ec_file.tsv`) the paitents, and a tab seperated file containing the paitent demographic data(`pt_demog.tsv`).  A fourth optional file is tab serparated Mother/Child data (`mc_file.tsv`) that will be used as TP data for some statistical analysis of imputed relationships and will be integrated into the family calulation

## Paitent file:

| MRN | FirstName | LastName | PhoneNumber | Zipcode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Stephen | Taylor | 111-111-1111 | 22182 |

Should only be one record per MRN, any duplicates will be dropped.

## Paitent emergency contact:

| MRN_1 | EC_FirstName | EC_LastName | EC_PhoneNumber | EC_Zipcode | EC_Relationship |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Katherine | Taylor | 222-222-2222 | 22182 | SPO |

MRN_1 in the emergency contact file should corrispond to the MRN in the Paitent file as the Emergency Contact information for that paitent.  A single MRN can have multiple Emergency Contacts.  Any EC relationship types not found in the `reference_files` will be dropped.

## Paitent demographic:

| MRN | BirthYear | Sex |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1960 | M |

The MRN in the Paitent demographic file should corrispond to the MRN in the Paitent file.  Should only be one record per MRN, any duplicates will be dropped.

## Mother Child Linkage:

| MRN_Child | MRN_Mother | BirthYear |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 21 | 22 | 2008 |

Toy example files can also be found in the `example_files` directory. Relationship abbreviation information, relationship groups, and their oposites can be found in the `reference_files` directory.

# Running RIFTEHR

Run example files with `python run_RIFTEHR.py --run_example`

Input files must be tab seperated.  Run on paitent data with the command:

 `python run_RIFTEHR.py --pt_file my_paitent_file.tsv --ec_file my_emergency_contact_file.tsv --dg_file my_pt_demographic_file.tsv --mc_link mc_file.tsv --out_dir output_directory`

 Run `python run_RIFTEHR.py -h` to view all options
